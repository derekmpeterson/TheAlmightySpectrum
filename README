This project was created in 48 hours by Derek Peterson for Ludum Dare 34 Compo.

You'll find there is a decent amount of disorganized and undocumented code due to the strict time constraints I had while creating the game.  I'll try to find some time to clean it up and document it after the Compo ends.


All code, art, music, and sfx were created within the competition timeframe, and are the sole property of Derek Peterson.  They are made available for reference and educational purposes, and to meet the Ludum Dare Compo requirements, but Derek Peterson reserves all copyright.
